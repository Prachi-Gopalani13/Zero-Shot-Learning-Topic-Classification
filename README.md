# Zero-Shot-Learning-Topic-Classification

Intro to Zero Shot Learning
Zero-shot learning is a transfer learning variant in which there are no labelled examples to learn during training. This method makes use of additional information to comprehend previously unseen data. Three variables are learned using this method. These are the input variable x, the output variable y, and the random variable T that describes the task. As a result, the model is trained to learn the conditional probability distribution P(x|y,T).
